Written Report

  The analysis covers various metrics related to student performance, including average math and reading scores, passing rates for math and reading, and overall passing rates. It also examines differences in performance based on school type, school size, and spending range.

 
Conclusions made from analyzing the data: 

    1. Charter Schools vs. District Schools: Charter schools have significantly higher performance metrics compared to district schools. The average math score for charter schools is 83.47% versus 76.96% for district schools. Similarly, the overall passing rate is 90.43% for charter schools compared to 53.67% for district schools.
    2. Impact of Spending on Performance: Schools with lower per-student spending (<$585) have higher average math (83.36%) and reading scores (83.96%), as well as higher overall passing rates (90.64%), compared to schools with higher spending ranges. Schools spending between $645-$680 have the lowest overall passing rate at 53.53%. This indicates that higher spending does not necessarily correlate with better student performance.
